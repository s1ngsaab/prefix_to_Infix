# prefix_to_Infix
This C++ program is designed to convert prefix expressions into their equivalent infix notation. Prefix expressions (also known as Polish notation) represent mathematical expressions where the operators precede their operands, while infix expressions have the standard operator placement between operands.
The program takes a prefix expression as input and generates the corresponding infix expression as output. It supports basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and parentheses to define the order of operations.
